The depletion of fossil fuel energy resources, increasing concern of air
pollution, global warming and energy crisis have encouraged the research for clean and
pollution free sources of energy. Wind energy is one of the most common of clean
energies that has been developed significantly in the world. This type of energy is more
accessible, inexhaustible, fairly cheaper, renewable and sustainable, and
environmentally friendly.

Wind energy is a free source of energy that has served the
mankind for many countries for driving wind turbines, pumping water, ships, etc.
Developing wind energy systems can improve the idea of electricity generation without
pollution in the future.

Renewable energy sources are getting more attention from the
energy production authorities, countries, and energy companies because of their
natural, free of costs, and environmentally clean nature.
